Well... I have always wanted to have a digital garden because I always take notes using Markdown, and I use it for almost everything in my life. I took up the challenge to learn in public, inspired by some people I follow on LinkedIn, and this was an idea that I procrastinated on for almost 2 years. **This was one of my challenges**, and now here I am.

Later on, when some of the seeds I've written reach a point where the information is clear, well-structured, and engaging enough to keep readers interested, I'll share them on other platforms. I might even create videos about them, which will definitely be a new challenge!

## What should readers expect from this?

First of all, this is a Digital Garden, so everything written here will be changed as my knowledge about the subjects is updated. I'm also using this to improve my writing skills.

### What am I using?

I'm using Astro with Markdown support.
